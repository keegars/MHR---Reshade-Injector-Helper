MHR - Reshade Injector Helper

After hearing issues with Reshade causing several issues with MH Rise, and the game causing crashes when it detects DLL wrappers. Hopefully this will provide a more stable experience for users. 

Any issues with the launcher, please leave a comment. Otherwise, install Reshade as usual with the shaders etc, and then use this to inject it!

This uses the alternative method that I discovered to get around MH Worlds issue.

Instead, with the help from the ReShade injector found here : https://framedsc.github.io/ReshadeGuides/reshadeuwp.htm and a bit of wizardy to make it easier to run one executable rather than remembering to run both in which order. This will provide a one-click helper. 

Note:
You can update ReShade by updating the ReShade64.dll (Current version 4.9.1) from the main ReShade website. 
You will need to move over your ReShade presets to the folders created OR go into the ReShade settings in-game and navigate back to your original folders.
